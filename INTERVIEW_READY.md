## 💻 Code Samples to Share

### 1. Custom Hook (Tic-Tac-Toe)
```typescript
function useTicTacToe() {
  const [board, setBoard] = useState<Board>(Array(9).fill(null));
  // Minimax algorithm for AI
  const findBestMove = (board: Board): number => {
    let bestScore = -Infinity;
    let bestMove = -1;
    for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
      if (board[i] === null) {
        board[i] = 'O';
        const score = minimax(board, 0, false);
        board[i] = null;
        if (score > bestScore) {
          bestScore = score;
          bestMove = i;
        }
      }
    }
    return bestMove;
  };
  // ...
}
```

### 2. Multi-API Data Aggregation
```typescript
const [usersRes, postsRes, commentsRes] = await Promise.all([
  axios.get('https://api.../users'),
  axios.get('https://api.../posts'),
  axios.get('https://api.../comments')
]);

const analyticsData = usersRes.data.map(user => ({
  userId: user.id,
  userName: user.name,
  totalPosts: postsByUser.get(user.id) || 0,
  totalComments: commentsByUser.get(user.id) || 0,
}));
```

### 3. Real-Time Monitoring
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  checkAllAPIs();
  const interval = setInterval(checkAllAPIs, 30000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);

const checkAPI = async (api: APIStatus) => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  try {
    await axios.get(api.endpoint, { timeout: 5000 });
    const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime;
    return { ...api, status: 'success', responseTime };
  } catch (error) {
    return { ...api, status: 'failure' };
  }
};
```
